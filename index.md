# Welcome to HT's(Happyiness Team) Pages

We chose Scoliosis Detection via X-ray Photo Recognition as the experimental subject.

The module we are responsible for is the server side. In fact, you can think of a server as an interface that integrates all functions. 

Since our work does not involve algorithms, if you want to challenge difficult topics, please choose to cooperate with other teams.
